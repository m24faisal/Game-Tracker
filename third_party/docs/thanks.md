# Thanks

As part of the open source release of rmqcpp, we've squashed the repository
history to remove proprietary content from the git logs. In doing so, we risk
losing the recognition of those who contributed to bringing rmqcpp to daily
production use in Bloomberg. We want to thank all of those who contributed
